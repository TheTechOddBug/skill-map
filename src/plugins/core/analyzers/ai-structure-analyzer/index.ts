/**
 * Built-in probabilistic `ai-structure-analyzer` Analyzer, one of the five
 * OPTIMIZATION finders (2026-07-22, user decision: the monolithic
 * `skill-optimizer` capability decomposed into topic finder / fixer
 * pairs). Judges ONE node for structural organization. Its judgments land in
 * `state_findings` as `type: 'structure'` rows (advisory, never
 * exit-code-bearing); read them with `sm findings`, in context with
 * `sm show`.
 *
 * As a probabilistic Analyzer it carries NO `evaluate()` (the
 * orchestrator excludes finders from every scan-time phase): the kernel
 * renders `prompt.md` + the canonical preamble + the report contract
 * into a queued job, an external agent processes it (`sm jobs claim`),
 * and `sm record` validates the JSON report against `report.schema.json`
 * before writing the findings through (`spec/job-lifecycle.md` §Record).
 *
 * Structure-as-truth siblings (`prompt.md` + `report.schema.json`) are
 * inlined onto the emitted manifest by the built-ins codegen. The report
 * schema `$ref`s the canonical findings envelope (the finder routing
 * signal) and narrows `findings[].type` to the const `'structure'`.
 *
 * Ships `stability: 'experimental'`: DISABLED by default (wave-1 birth
 * convention; graduate once the prompt proves itself). Enable with
 * `sm plugins enable core/ai-structure-analyzer`.
