/**
 * `node-body.ts`, on-demand body reader for `/api/nodes/:pathB64?include=body`.
 *
 * The kernel deliberately persists `body_hash` / `bytes_body` / `tokens_body`
 * (per spec/db-schema.md §scan_nodes) but NOT the body bytes themselves,
 * the body is human content, not machine state, and duplicating it in
 * SQLite would inflate the DB without serving any read-side query the
 * kernel cares about. Inspector cards that DO want to render the body
 * (markdown preview at Step 14.5) opt into a filesystem re-read by
 * passing `?include=body`.
 *
 * Two pieces:
 *
 *   1. `readNodeBody(cwd, relPath)`, resolves the node path against the
 *      scope root, refuses any resolved path that escapes the root
 *      (defense-in-depth for path-traversal, `node.path` is supposed to
 *      be relative-and-inside, but a corrupted DB row or a future
 *      Provider that doesn't sanitise its paths shouldn't be able to
 *      hand the BFF a `../../../etc/passwd`), reads UTF-8 from disk, and
 *      strips frontmatter delimiters. Returns `null` on missing file
 *      (ENOENT) or path-traversal violation; bubbles unexpected errors.
 *
 *   2. `stripFrontmatter(raw)`, removes a leading `---\n…\n---\n?` block
 *      if present, otherwise returns the input unchanged. Tolerates
 *      both LF and CRLF EOLs.
 *
 * Callers handle the `null` return as "body unavailable", the SPA
 * inspector renders an empty-state card instead of crashing. Stale-vs-DB
 * detection (file changed since last scan) is NOT this module's job:
 * the watcher will re-emit a `scan.completed` and the loader's reactive
 * refresh will catch up.
