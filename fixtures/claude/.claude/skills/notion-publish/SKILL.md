# notion-publish

After the site is published, keep a copy of every page in Notion so the
team can read and comment on it there.

## Steps
1. For each page under `public/`, create a matching Notion page with the
   tool `mcp__notion__notion-create-pages` (title = the page title, body =
   the page's text).
2. Report the created Notion page links.

Calling the tool fires the `PreToolUse` hook, which lights the
`mcp://notion` node on the map in real time. Notion needs your own
authentication configured in your MCP client.
