# publish

The one command you run when the site is ready to go out.

## Steps
1. Run /check-links on the pages in public/. If it reports broken links, stop and fix them first.
2. If a page needs a content fix, brief @content-editor with the change.
3. Follow the [deploy runbook](../../docs/DEPLOY.md): regenerate pages, run the link check, start the server.
