Frontmatter coverage pass for Claude and the Agent Skills open standard, plus a breaking revert of dual-source tags to single-source. Claude's `skill-base` gains the `disallowed-tools` denylist; the `agent-skills` Provider declares the open-standard `license` / `compatibility` / `metadata` / `allowed-tools` fields; and `tags` now live only in the `.sm` sidecar, dropping the universal `tags` field, the `scan_node_tags.source` column, and the `sm list --tag-source` flag.

## User-facing

Claude skills and commands now show their `disallowed-tools` in the inspector. Tags come only from `.sm` sidecars now: the `sm list --tag-source` flag is removed and cards show a single tag style. Agent Skills `license` / `compatibility` / `metadata` fields are recognized.
