Second pass of the release-pipeline shakedown after the pnpm migration. The first pass (`verify-release-pipeline`) surfaced two issues that this bump exists to verify the fixes for: (a) the Railway demo deploy crashed in `web/scripts/build-demo-dataset.js` because `node --import tsx` could not resolve `tsx` from the demo fixture's cwd (pnpm's strict hoist keeps it in `src/node_modules/`), and (b) the post-publish smoke step hit `ETARGET` on `@skill-map/cli@latest` because the npm CDN had not yet propagated tarball metadata at every edge when the install ran. Both are now fixed: `build-demo-dataset.js` imports the tsx loader by absolute `file://` URL, and the smoke step now reads the explicit version from `changesets.outputs.publishedPackages` and retries up to 5 times with 30 second back-off. No code or contract change in any of the four packages.
