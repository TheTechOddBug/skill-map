Add opt-in, anonymous usage analytics (PostHog) for the CLI and UI, OFF by default. Three independent toggles in `~/.skill-map/settings.json` (`telemetry.usageCliEnabled`, `usageUiEnabled`, alongside `errorsEnabled`); one shared first-run prompt consents to all and mints an anonymous install id used as the PostHog `distinct_id`, exposed read-only via `GET/PATCH /api/preferences`. `SKILL_MAP_TELEMETRY=0` force-disables every surface. Contract: `spec/telemetry.md`.

## User-facing

skill-map can now share anonymous usage (which commands and views you use) to guide development, OFF by default. Toggle CLI usage, UI usage, and error reports independently in Settings, or set `SKILL_MAP_TELEMETRY=0` to force all off. Files and paths are never sent.
